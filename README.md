Included above is the Rmd file for the NYPD Shooting Incident data final project. 
When you open the file in R Studio, it may prompt you to download several packages. 
Please allow R Studio to download the packages so that the file will knit properly.
The final project is part of the course Data Science as a Field at Colorado Boulder.
Thank you for grading my project for me. I appreciate it.
